# Edinburgh-QFT
Material for the QFT course at the University of Edinburgh

This is a repository for the material used to teach the level-11
course on Quantum Field Theory at the School of Physics and Astronomy
in Edinburgh. 

All material is provisional, peppered with typos, and subject to continuous revisions. 

Have fun!
